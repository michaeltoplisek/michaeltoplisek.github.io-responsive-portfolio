        Hi! My name is Michael Toplisek. Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I used to work as contractor renovating houses, but wanted to change my career.
        I have always liked creating things, especially music, which is part of the reason why I wanted to
        get
        into coding. I think its the future of the work force and love the challenges and constant innovation and learning it requires. It is also very creative and rewarding.
        Theres no greater feeling than working on something and putting your all into it and see it come
        out at
        the end the way you invision it in your head.
      </p>

        of the means provided. Thanks again!
